# Security Test Results

## Overview

This document provides details on security testing performed on the Pandemic Resilience System (PRS). Testing was conducted to verify the proper implementation of security measures, detect potential vulnerabilities, and ensure the protection of sensitive data.

## Security Features Tested

The following security features were tested:

1. JWT-based Authentication
2. SQL Injection Prevention
3. Input Validation
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
5. File Upload Security
6. HTTP Security Headers
7. Role-Based Access Control
8. Audit Logging

## Test Results

### 1. JWT Authentication Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Invalid Token Format | Send request with malformed JWT token | 401 Unauthorized response | 401 Unauthorized response | PASS |
| Expired Token | Send request with expired token | 401 Unauthorized response | 401 Unauthorized response | PASS |
| Missing Token | Send request without token to protected endpoint | 401 Unauthorized response | 401 Unauthorized response | PASS |
| Valid Token | Send request with valid token | 200 OK response | 200 OK response | PASS |

**Notes**: The JWT implementation correctly validates token structure, expiration, and signature. Token expiration is set to 24 hours, providing a good balance between security and user convenience.

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Login Injection | Attempt login with `' OR 1=1; --` as email | 401 Unauthorized | 401 Unauthorized | PASS |
| User ID Injection | Request user with ID `1 OR 1=1` | Error or 404 Not Found | 404 Not Found | PASS |
| User Search Injection | Search with special characters `%"'<>` | Properly escaped query | Properly escaped query | PASS |

**Notes**: All database queries use prepared statements with parameter binding, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks. The system does not construct SQL queries using string concatenation.

### 3. Input Validation Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Empty Required Fields | Submit empty values for required fields | 400 Bad Request | 400 Bad Request | PASS |
| Invalid Email Format | Submit invalid email format | Validation error | Validation error | PASS |
| XSS in Input Fields | Submit `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in text fields | Content properly escaped | Content properly escaped | PASS |
| Oversized Input | Submit extremely long string (10,000+ chars) | Proper handling/rejection | Proper handling/rejection | PASS |

**Notes**: Input validation is consistently applied across all API endpoints. The system validates both the presence of required fields and the format of specialized fields (email, dates, etc.).

### 4. File Upload Security Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Upload Valid File | Upload PDF file | Success | Success | PASS |
| Upload Executable | Upload .exe file | Rejection | Rejection with clear error | PASS |
| Upload Oversized File | Upload file > 10MB | Rejection | Rejection with size limit error | PASS |
| Upload Without Auth | Upload without authentication | 401 Unauthorized | 401 Unauthorized | PASS |

**Notes**: File upload validation is implemented correctly, allowing only permitted file types (PDF, JPEG, PNG, GIF). Files are renamed with unique identifiers to prevent overwriting. The upload directory structure prevents directory traversal attacks.

### 5. HTTP Security Headers Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| X-Content-Type-Options | Check response header | nosniff | nosniff | PASS |
| X-XSS-Protection | Check response header | 1; mode=block | 1; mode=block | PASS |
| X-Frame-Options | Check response header | SAMEORIGIN | SAMEORIGIN | PASS |

**Notes**: The application implements important security headers to protect against common attacks. However, Content-Security-Policy header is not implemented, which would provide additional protection against XSS.

### 6. Role-Based Access Control Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Public Member Access - Health Facilities | Attempt to access health facilities as Public Member | Access denied | Access denied | PASS |
| Public Member Access - Supply Management | Attempt to access supply management as Public Member | Access denied | Access denied | PASS |
| Doctor Access - Supply Management | Attempt to modify supply inventory as Doctor | Allowed with limited permissions | Allowed with limited permissions | PASS |
| Non-Gov User Delete Attempt | Attempt to delete facility as non-Gov user | 403 Forbidden | 403 Forbidden | PASS |

**Notes**: Role-based access control is properly implemented, with appropriate permission checks for different user roles. Government Officials have full access, Doctors have partial access, and Public Members have limited access.

### 7. Audit Logging Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| User Login | Check audit log after login | Login action logged | Login action logged | PASS |
| Create Record | Create vaccination record and check log | Creation action logged | Creation action logged | PASS |
| Upload Document | Upload document and check log | Upload action logged | Upload action logged | PASS |
| Admin Action | Perform admin action and check log | Admin action logged with user ID | Admin action logged with user ID | PASS |

**Notes**: The system maintains an audit trail of important actions, including login attempts, record creation, and administrative operations. Each log entry includes the user ID, action performed, entity affected, and timestamp.

## Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

| Vulnerability | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|---------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Missing Content-Security-Policy | Medium | CSP header not implemented, potentially allowing XSS attacks | Implement CSP header in .htaccess file |
| Weak Password Policy | Medium | No enforced password complexity | Implement password strength requirements |
| No Rate Limiting | Low | No protection against brute force attacks | Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints |
| No CSRF Protection | Low | No CSRF tokens implemented | Implement CSRF token validation for state-changing operations |

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Content-Security-Policy Header**: Add a CSP header to restrict the sources of executable scripts, further protecting against XSS attacks.

2. **Enhance Password Policy**: Implement and enforce password complexity requirements (minimum length, special characters, numbers, etc.).

3. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

4. **Add CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations, especially for forms.

5. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider adding 2FA for users with elevated privileges (Government Officials).

6. **Regular Security Audits**: Establish a schedule for regular security audits and penetration testing.

7. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools into the development process to identify vulnerabilities early.

8. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database, especially medical information.

## Conclusion

The Pandemic Resilience System implements several key security features that protect against common web application vulnerabilities. The system's authentication mechanism, input validation, and role-based access control are robust. However, implementing the recommendations above would further enhance the security posture of the application.

This security testing confirmed that the core security features are working as intended, with all tested areas passing their respective test cases. The identified vulnerabilities are relatively minor and can be addressed in future updates.
