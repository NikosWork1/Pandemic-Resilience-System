### 4.2 API Testing Results

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| API-001 | Login with valid credentials | HTTP 200, JWT token returned | HTTP 200, JWT token received | PASS |
| API-002 | Login with invalid password | HTTP 401, Error message | HTTP 401, Error message received | PASS |
| API-003 | Login with non-existent user | HTTP 401, Error message | HTTP 401, Error message received | PASS |
| API-004 | Login with empty fields | HTTP 400, Validation error | HTTP 400, Error message received | PASS |
| API-005 | Get all users (authenticated) | HTTP 200, User array | HTTP 200, User array received | PASS |
| API-006 | Get all users (unauthenticated) | HTTP 401, Error message | HTTP 401, Error message received | PASS |
| API-007 | Create user with valid data | HTTP 201, Success message | HTTP 201, Success message received | PASS |
| API-008 | Create user with invalid email | HTTP 400, Error message | User created with invalid email | FAIL |
| API-009 | Get vaccination records | HTTP 200, Records array | HTTP 200, Records array received | PASS |
| API-010 | Upload document without authentication | HTTP 401, Error message | HTTP 401, Error message received | PASS |

**API Testing Failures**: 
- Test case API-008 failed because the API accepted invalid email formats without proper validation. This has been fixed by implementing email validation in the user registration endpoint.

### 4.3 Frontend Testing Results

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Browser | Status |
|--------------|------------------|---------|--------|
| FE-001 | Login form validation | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-002 | Login form validation | Firefox | FAIL |
| FE-003 | Login form validation | Edge | PASS |
| FE-004 | Login form validation | Safari | PASS |
| FE-005 | Dashboard charts rendering | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-006 | Dashboard charts rendering | Firefox | PASS |
| FE-007 | Dashboard charts rendering | Edge | PASS |
| FE-008 | Dashboard charts rendering | Safari | PASS |
| FE-009 | User registration | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-010 | User registration | Firefox | FAIL |
| FE-011 | Navigation menu | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-012 | Responsive design (mobile) | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-013 | Responsive design (tablet) | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-014 | Health facilities page | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-015 | Supply management page | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-016 | File upload functionality | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-017 | Chart data display | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-018 | User account display | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-019 | Logout functionality | Chrome | PASS |
| FE-020 | Error handling | Chrome | PASS |

**Frontend Testing Failures**:
- Test cases FE-002 and FE-010 failed due to inconsistent form validation behavior in Firefox. This has been fixed by implementing additional JavaScript validation to supplement HTML5 validation.

### 4.4 Security Testing Results

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Status |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| SEC-001 | JWT authentication and verification | PASS |
| SEC-002 | SQL injection prevention | PASS |
| SEC-003 | Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection | PASS |

**Security Testing Notes**:
All security tests passed, confirming that the system is protected against common web vulnerabilities. The authentication system correctly prevents unauthorized access, and input validation mechanisms successfully prevent injection attacks.

### 4.5 Performance Testing Results

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| PERF-001 | Login page load time | < 100ms | 87ms | PASS |
| PERF-002 | Registration page load time | < 100ms | 78ms | PASS |
| PERF-003 | Dashboard page load time | < 150ms | 83ms | PASS |

- **Resolution**: Added proper email validation using PHP's filter_var function with FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL flag.
- **Status**: Resolved

### 5.3 Mobile Performance
- **Issue**: Dashboard had higher load times on mobile devices.
- **Resolution**: Optimized chart rendering and implemented responsive design adjustments for mobile views.
- **Status**: Resolved

## 6. Integration Testing Results

Integration testing confirmed that the frontend, API, and database components work correctly together as a complete system. The tests verified:

1. **User Authentication Flow**: Registration, login, and JWT token usage across the application
2. **Data Persistence**: Data created through the UI is correctly stored in the database and retrievable
3. **API Communication**: Frontend components correctly communicate with API endpoints
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles have appropriate access to system features

All integration test scenarios passed after resolving the identified issues.

## 7. Recommendations

Based on the testing results, the following recommendations are made:

### 7.1 Frontend Improvements
- Implement more comprehensive client-side validation for all forms
- Enhance error messaging to provide more specific feedback to users
